# What's Cooking?

## Description
What's Cooking? is a full stack web app that promotes food sustainability by recommending recipes based on the existing ingredients that a user has in their fridge.

## Motivation
People often purchase significantly more food than they actually end up eating. In a small survey by SciTechDaily, the participants predicted finishing "97 percent of the meat in their refrigerators but really finished only about half. The same trends can be seen for vegetables, fruit, dairy. One reason this occurs is because people often do not consume all (or even majority) of their ingredients before their next grocery stop. People are inclined to purchase food again when there no apparent recipes can be created from the existing ingredients in their fridge.
